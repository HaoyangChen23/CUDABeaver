# Task curation funnel

Reconstructed end-to-end with verifiable evidence (file paths refer to the
authors' working repository; counts marked ✓ are re-derivable from artifacts
bundled in this release).

| stage | count | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| 0. imported generation-task universe | 742 | upstream families imported (CUDA samples 210, cudnn 113, CUTLASS 94, cublas 79, KernelBench L1 54 / L2 35 of 100 each, cutile 48, curand 34, cusolver 29, cusparse 27, cufft 7, KH class2 6, ThunderKittens 4, class3 2) |
| 1. generation-mode curation | 166 | quality/priority screen ("240 high-quality cases" collapsed to 166 configured) |
| 2. v1 debug panel | 166×5 | 5 source models attempt every task |
| 3. quality triage | 166 | trivial 2 / all-solved 2 / mixed 111 / none-solved 51 |
| 4. v2 exclusions | 145 | −21: 9 trivial-at-iter-1, 7 near-trivial (4/5 models), 5 infra-broken (audited per-task) |
| 5. broken-start selection | 145 | 1 per stem from real model iter-1 failures; 20–600 line window, anti-cheat static checks, category-quota balancing (144 auto + 1 manual) |
| 6. KernelHell backfill | 208 | +63 applied-family tasks (CUTLASS 20, class2 43) after metadata/compile screens |
| 7. v2 final list | 200 ✓ | −8 flash_attn head-dim/dtype variants |
| 8. v3 supplement | +16 | memory-crash instances harvested from v1 iterations |
| 9. paper corpus | 213 ✓ | 200 + 16 − 3 exact-duplicate broken starts |
| 10. this release | 228 ✓ | post-submission memory-crash expansion (+20/−4, incl. new cudabench family) and per-task fixes |

Honest limitations of the record: per-source rejection counts for stage 0→1
and the intermediate 240-case artifact of stage 1 were not preserved; the
recorded reason for the 8 dropped variants at stage 7 was not; one
KernelHell class2 count (43 vs 44 in the design doc) is unexplained.

Solvability criterion, stated precisely: kept tasks are **reference-solvable**
(a working reference implementation passes the testbench — see
`tests/test_family_fixtures.py`) and audited as non-infrastructure-broken.
Panel-solvability was NOT enforced: the hardest tier is intentionally
unsolved by all evaluated fixers (headroom).
